# Disclaimer and Statement of Purpose

## 1. Primary Purpose: Game Research & Simulation
This software, **Stealth Thief Escape**, is primarily developed as a simulation tool for research in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and game development. It is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in a complex, hazardous environment.

## 2. Law Enforcement & Tactical Simulation Utility
The architecture of this simulation allows for the integration of real-world environment data. Once trained with environment-specific layouts, this tool may assist law enforcement and tactical teams in:
- **Scenario Modeling**: Simulating potential escape routes and movement patterns in a defined crime scene.
- **Strategic Planning**: Identifying blind spots in surveillance or patrol perimeters based on AI-discovered optimal paths.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the effectiveness of stationary and mobile security placement.

## 3. Limitations and Accuracy
- **Model vs. Reality**: While the AI can find optimal paths within the grid, real-world variables (human behavior, environmental dynamics, etc.) are significantly more complex.
- **Simulation Fidelity**: This is a simplified 2D grid representation and should not be used as the sole basis for critical tactical decisions.

## 4. Ethical Use and Compliance
Users are responsible for ensuring that the application of this tool complies with all local laws and ethical guidelines regarding simulation and surveillance modeling. 

## 5. No Liability
The developers assume no liability for the misuse of this tool or for any actions taken based on the results of the simulation. This software is provided "as-is" for analytical and entertainment purposes.
